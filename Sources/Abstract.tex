\chapter*{Abstract}
\noindent
This work is concerned with object detection in images based on state-of-the-art
deep neural networks. The thesis is a result of a collaboration with
company SANEZOO EUROPE that provided image datasets. The work introduces
selected object detection models that were further evaluated according to
appropriate metrics on provided datasets. For future evaluations of the models
on an arbitrary datasets, we implemented a simple benchmarking tool that
can be controlled via web user interface.
