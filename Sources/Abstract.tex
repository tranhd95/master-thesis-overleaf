\chapter*{Abstract}
\noindent
This work is concerned with object detection in images based on state-of-the-art
deep neural networks. The thesis is a result of a collaboration with company
SANEZOO EUROPE that provided image datasets. First we introduce selected deep
learning object detection models. We evaluate them on provided datasets using
appropriate metrics. The evaluation results are used to compare and discuss the
models' performance. For future evaluations of the models on an arbitrary
datasets, we implement a simple benchmarking tool that can be controlled via
web user interface.
